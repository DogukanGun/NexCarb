# NexCarb - Real-Time Data Collection Network

## Project Aim

The aim of this project is to:
- Collect real-time data via a **distributed network**.
- Use this collected data for **oracles** and **AI models** in the near future.
- Replace **corrupted middlemen** with people who directly collect data and earn money for their contributions.

## Process

### Node Types

There are **two types of nodes** used to collect data:

1. **Sensor Nodes**
   - Sensor nodes work on vehicles.
   - A user orders a device and attaches it to their vehicle.
   - Once activated, the device starts collecting real-time data.
   - After reaching the maximum data limit, the device **sells the data** to the network.
   - Firms or individuals can buy this data from the network marketplace.

2. **Search Nodes**
   - Search nodes are lightweight and operate on **users' phones**.
   - A search node connects to the network and manages **multiple devices**.
   - When a data request comes to the network (e.g., from a firm or individual), the search node:
     - Randomly selects connected phones.
     - Responds to the selected phone's query with data instructions.
     - The phone fetches the required data in the background and sends it back to the network.

### Additional Nodes

- **Manager Node**:  
  A bootstrap node that stores and manages information about other nodes in the network.

- **AI Node** *(Upcoming)*:  
  An AI node will be introduced to train and run **AI models** using the collected data.

- **Main Oracle**:  
  The oracle node processes and utilizes the collected data inside the network.

## Earning Mechanism

The network enables data collectors and contributors to earn revenue as follows:

1. **Data Collection**:  
   Users earn money by selling the data they collect.

2. **Data Marketplace**:  
   Firms or individuals can purchase datasets directly from the network's marketplace.

3. **Revenue Distribution**:  
   Revenue generated from each dataset purchase is distributed to:
   - **Network operators**
   - **Data collectors**
   - **The platform**

4. **Payment Options**:  
   Datasets can be purchased using:
   - **USDC** (USD Coin)
   - **The network's native token**

## Summary

This project decentralizes real-time data collection and incentivizes individuals to contribute data using distributed nodes. By cutting out middlemen, the platform ensures transparency and rewards data collectors fairly.
